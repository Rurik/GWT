  yourself (With the "\" at the end!))

                        -={GWT .009a}=-

- nuttin big.. just made it into modules (well, Jeff started)
  The source now has just 34k in it, maybe less.
  I included all i could in the modules. From now on, lets keep
  everything that we can in seperate modules from the main.
                                                
- Total reconstruction of the menus. Game looks unlike anything
  its ever been like (or any other game I've seen).

  if price is $500)

  complications

  GWT batch and EXE ya know? <g>

  They also can handle lines with ; at the beginning and blank
  lines.

  This lets us have any ansi in it, also I put in Jeff's ansi.

* A special bug fix for open.an?. It wouldn't display last line
  for some reason <g>

; Added in another IGM, Cave IGM. This has player convo and
  more.

  returning from IGM.

  an IGM.

; Added IGM ability (you must have NO spaces at end.
  Goes like this:
  Description - My New IGM
  File Name- IGM.EXE
  ok... well, you gotta edit IGM.DAT to add em.
  I included a sample one called GAME.BAS.
  Oh, you also have to compile GAME.BAS and GWT.BAS.
  If you don't, it won't work.
  The GWT.BAT runs a special file if its found to start the IGM.
  The way I did it is better then Seth's :) Cuz mine doesn't need
  to worry bout error levels. 1 flaw is the spaces at end though.
  Use IGM's in Xtra places.

                        -={GWT .005a}=-

; Added in all of Jetlag's code from .004b.

- Enemies on different levels have been enabled, even
  though there is no way to go up more levels. :(

; Save challenges (fights) in locker and save money from
  bank terminal.

                        -={GWT .004a}=-

; EDITOR.BAS made which includes a monster editor, player editor,
  and player packer. Thanks to Brian :) (ok, one name didn't hurt? :-)

; Will make score file when user quits game, saving time and gets more
  accurate listings.

; Made Config for it. Now you can change the path, and what you want
  for the scores. More to be added, just lazy! :)

; Added Arena fights and modified player editor structure.
  Get rid of your old player file <g> Sorrrrrrryyyyyy! :)
  You Can't edit the new stuff in player editor yet.
  Maybe one of you add it? I'm getting some other stuff together.

; Can't go passed Total Arena Fights per day.

* Got rid of Brian's excess code (the haven't found shit feature :)
  It didn't work (your new way disabled it, but you bundled it in)
