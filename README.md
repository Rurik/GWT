Galactic Warriors Tournament - BBS Door Game<br>
<br>
I started work on this is early 1995, with two other members of the 609 BBS scene, CodeRed (Geoff Rivell) and jetlag (Jeff Biermann). It was a BBS door game based loosely off a futuristic, Sci-Fi LORD (Legend Of The Red Dragon). Work started out with QBasic, at a time when I was also writing a modem terminal proggy in QB. In early 1996 I started getting heavy into Pascal, and proceeded to convert the unfinished code over to it, forcing my peers to learn a new language. Development continued into the summer of 1997, where interest and motivation dropped. Why? I don't remember, that was too long ago. I had high hopes for this program, and spent literally days hunched over a calculator determining battle code algorithms, for attacks and defends (I should've just based it off of AD&D rules). <br>

The program may not run. There is issues with the current Turbo Pascal in compiling and running older program. There are patches available.<br><br>
